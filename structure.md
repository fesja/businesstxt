Several locations
-----------------

That's a good question. The standard support the option to have several spots on the same business.txt file. You can have different data for each spot.

* Start with the common data
* Add a location block for each spot starting with the `Street` field adding any extra field of the business.txt standard. You can override any field of the common data. So for example, you can have a common schedule in all spots except in one that it's different.
